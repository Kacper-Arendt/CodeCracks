# Articles, Finance Tracker

This is a full-stack React & Express application built with Turborepo that allows users to manage their articles, keep track of
their finances.

The main reason why I created this project is the desire to master managing multiple projects in one monorepo

## Features

- Articles: Users can create, edit, delete articles as well as view them on the blog(Next.js).
- Finance Tracker: Users can add, edit, and delete their
- financial transactions, categorize them, and view their overall financial status.
